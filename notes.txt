**** ____ Identifying where your state should Be: ---- ****

For each piece of state in your application:

-Identify every component that renders something based on that state.

-Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy).

-Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.

-If you canâ€™t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component simply for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.
